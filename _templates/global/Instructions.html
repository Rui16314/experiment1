        <p class="card-text">
            Welcome to the ECON 3310 Experiment Platform.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            This experiment has two parts. Each part includes three separate sessions. In each session, 
            you'll complete 10 rounds. Therefore, you will play an auction game over 6 sessions, totaling 60 rounds. 
            Each round is expected to take about 1 minute or less. Overall, the experiment should take no more than 75 minutes, 
            including review of instructions.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            Participating in this experiment will earn you 100 POINTS.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            You can earn extra points in each round, and these points are mostly affected by your choices and those of your opponents. 
            Points earned in each round and session will be added up. Therefore, each round matters, and it's important to make the most of each one.

                You will play 10 rounds of this game. At the start of each round, you'll be randomly paired with a different participant. 
                This means your matches will change from round to round, and you'll never know who you'll be paired with in any given round.
            {% elif session_number == 2 %}
                You will play 10 rounds of the same game you played in the previous session. The only difference is that you will play all 10 rounds against the same opponent. 
                So, your opponent will stay the same throughout the rounds.
            {% elif session_number == 3 %}
                You will play 10 rounds of the same game you played in the previous session. The only difference is that you will now be able to communicate with your opponent through the chatbox.
            {% elif session_number == 4 %}
                You will play 10 rounds of this game. At the start of each round, you'll be randomly paired with a different participant. 
                This means your matches will change from round to round, and you'll never know who you'll be paired with in any given round.
            {% elif session_number == 5 %}
                You will play 10 rounds of the same game you played in the previous session. The only difference is that you will play all 10 rounds against the same opponent. 
                So, your opponent will stay the same throughout the rounds.
            {% elif session_number == 6 %}
                You will play 10 rounds of the same game you played in the previous session. The only difference is that you will now be able to communicate with your opponent through the chatbox.

        <p class="card-text">
            The seller is auctioning an indivisible item, and two buyers—yourself and your opponent, whom we match randomly—are interested in purchasing it. 
            In each round, you'll participate in an auction to buy the good.
        </p>
        
        <p class="card-text">
            In each round, your valuation and your opponent's will be assigned randomly. Therefore, your and your opponent's valuations will probably differ in each round. 
            You will always know your own valuation but won't learn your opponent's until the round ends. Valuations are chosen independently and uniformly from 0 to 100, 
            in increments of cents. As a result, your valuation will be 0.01n with a probability of 1/10,000, where n ranges from 0 to 10,000.
        </p>
        
        <p class="card-text">
            In each round, after learning your valuation, you have 1 minute to place your bid. 
            {% if session_number == 3 or session_number == 6 %}
                <strong>You may communicate with your opponent before submitting your bid. Feel free to discuss any matter, but please keep your identity confidential.</strong>
            {% endif %}
            Once you submit your bid, the round will end. You will not see your opponent's bid until after the round ends, 
            when you learn the winning bid and how many points you earned that round.
        </p>
        
        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">POINTS YOU EARN IN EACH ROUND WILL DEPEND ON THESE THREE FACTORS</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Your bid</li>
            <li>Your opponent's bid</li>
            <li>Your valuation</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p class="card-text">More specifically,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If your bid is less than your opponent's bid, then you lose the auction and receive 0 points.</li>
            <li>
                If your bid is higher than your opponent's bid, then you win the auction. Thus, your points will be:
                {% if session_number <= 3 %}
                    <strong>Your points = Your valuation - Your bid</strong>
                {% else %}
                    <strong>Your points = Your valuation - Your opponent's bid</strong>
                {% endif %}
            </li>
            <li>
                If your bid is equal to your opponent's bid, then your points will be determined according to the following:
                {% if session_number <= 3 %}
                    <strong>Your points = (Your valuation - Your bid) / 2</strong>
                {% else %}
                    <strong>Your points = (Your valuation - Your opponent's bid) / 2</strong>
                {% endif %}
            </li>
            <li>If you do not submit your bid within the 1-minute window, you lose the auction and receive 0 points.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="card-text">
            At the end of each round, you will find out whether you win the auction, your opponent's valuation, bid, and your points.
